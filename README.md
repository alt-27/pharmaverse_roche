## pharmaverse_roche
# Roche PD Data Science Task

Welcome to my attempt in this assessment. Note that it is still a work in progress and please be patient :)

This repository contains R programs to derive:
- SDTM DS (Disposition)
- ADaM ADSL (Subject-Level Analysis Dataset)
- Data Visualisation

The implementation uses pharmaverse packages (pharmaverseraw, pharmaversesdtm, sdtm.oak, admiral) along with tidyverse tools.

Here are my work on Q1 to Q3 that I have completed so far. You can also view the log files and outputs in the respective folders. 
```{r completed scripts for assesment}
source("question_1_sdtm/01_create_ds_domain.R")
source("question_2_adam/create_adsl.R")
source("question_3_tlg/01_create_ae_summary_table.R)
source("question_3_tlg/02_create_visualizations.R)
```

Stay Tuned for Q4!
