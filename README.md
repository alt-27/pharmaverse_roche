## pharmaverse_roche
# Roche PD Data Science Task

Welcome to my attempt in this task. Note that it is still a work in progress and please be patient :)

This repository contains R programs to derive:
- SDTM DS (Disposition)
- ADaM ADSL (Subject-Level Analysis Dataset)

The implementation uses pharmaverse packages (pharmaverseraw, pharmaversesdtm, sdtm.oak, admiral) along with tidyverse tools.

```{r completed scripts for assesment}
source("question_1_sdtm/01_create_ds_domain.R")
source("question_2_adam/create_adsl.R")
```

To be continued for question 3 and 4
